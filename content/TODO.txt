Programming Related Bugs/Improvements
==========================================================================================

Levels 
	- growth rates based on classes and gender
	- allow for characters that do not gain levels

Inventory/Spells redesign
	- Must be easier to touch items on the inventory
	- Item buttons and equipping must be clearer
	- Spells can be laid out better
	- Fix those god awful give buttons
	
Implement proper outside mode - current outside mode is incomplete

Finish spells 
	- some spells are incomplete/disabled
	- spells can miss (and most do very often)
Fix status effects
	- Most apply on every move
	- Super overpowered, must be able to be resisted

Redo Combat System
	- Nodes in combat mode should execute for only the person stepping on them
	- Cast only in combat mode
	- Multiple spell levels
	- Ways to learn spells from quest/random node
	- Show status effect damages correctly instead of stacked one on top of the other
	- Determine a way to use the SPD stat (double hits perhaps?)
	- Cause a "pick up" or a "use" action to cost action points
	- Make classes effect weapon bonuses and armor detriments

Dialogue Redesign
	- System works, but it needs more clarity on what to do (Spellcheck? WTF?)
	- Allow SHOPS to be made from the dialogue
	- Allow state and saves to switch active dialogue for npc characters
	- Allow nodes to be called from dialogue

Implement Quests - Have a node that modifies quest information (dialogue, rewards?)

--- Dumb Bugs and Inconveniences, Low-ish priority for now
LocalStorage saving - Saves to localstorage are persistant + download option
	- Test saves + loads for inconsistancies
Confirm on Item Remove - When removing an item from inventory, confirm removal
Weight Properties - Make items have weight properties and calculate carrying capacity
Allow items to be picked up on mobile - Mobile cannot press 'g' to get items
Fix Minimap Drawing Speed - its really slow and disabled at the moment
Audio on Mobile - currently all audio is disabled due to a loading bug
Variable Game Speed - game runs at 1 speed and might be too fast for players
Touch Screen Hold To Run - currently now you have to tap the screen to move
In create screen, highlight which stats are affected by class choice
Make a 'Back' or 'To Game' button when you're in a menu - People getting confused on
	how to get back into the game from inverntory/party manager
Move 'logout' portal somewhere else (Save maybe?) - need space for more stuff
Make Sprites have discernable colors - If you have 2 female archers, they have the 
	same sprite.  You must be able to tell them apart for clarity.
In the create screen, hide buttons at the top when not in the main screen - might
	hit "Done" thinking it will take you back to the main screen
Make towns actually angry at you for attacking allied characters.
Fix status effects in town mode - They apply multiple times per move
Make a more clear indicator that a party member has low health/died - hard to tell
